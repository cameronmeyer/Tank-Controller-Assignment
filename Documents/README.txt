WASD/↑←↓→ - Move Tank (Strafe)

Innovation Added:
- Camera shake on projectile impacts via Cinemachine

Difficulties:
The assignment document was broken into two sections, which made it seem like pre- and post-progress check. I realized too close to the deadline that I was behind on my progress. In future assignments, it would make it clearer to label similar sections like "Week 1 of 4 Progress (No Turn-In)" or "Mid-Project Progress (Turn-In Due)"
